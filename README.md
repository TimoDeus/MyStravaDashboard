# Frontend Boilerplate with React, Redux & TypeScript

My opinionated boilerplate using React, Redux and TypeScript. Based on [Rokoroku's](https://github.com/rokoroku/react-redux-typescript-boilerplate) boilerplate, I added the following plugins:

- [x] Redux Thunk
- [x] Redux Logger
- [x] TSLint with ESLint rules
- [x] Axios

## Setup

$ npm install
```

## Running

```
$ npm start
```

```

$ npm run format
```
